# Ambiguity Analysis

**Stage:** /review (PRD Review)
**Focus:** What's unclear, contradictory, or underspecified

## Role

Find statements in the spec that are ambiguous or open to multiple interpretations.

## Checklist

### Vague Language
- Weasel words: "fast", "simple", "reasonable", "appropriate", "as needed", "etc."
- Undefined quantities: "many", "some", "a few", "large", "small"
- Hedge words: "usually", "generally", "in most cases" — what about the other cases?
- "Easy" or "intuitive" without defining for whom

### Undefined Terms
- Domain concepts used without definition (jargon, acronyms)
- Technical terms used ambiguously (does "cache" mean in-memory, on-disk, CDN?)
- "User" without distinguishing between user types/personas
- Borrowed terminology from other features that may mean something different here

### Contradictions
- Two requirements that can't both be true simultaneously
- Conflicting priorities without explicit hierarchy
- "Must" in one place, "should" for the same thing elsewhere
- Diagrams or examples that don't match the text description

### Underspecification
- Conditional requirements without defined conditions ("when X" but X isn't defined)
- Scope boundaries stated as "similar to X" without defining what "similar" means
- Undefined ordering when multiple things need to happen
- Missing default behavior: what happens if no choice is made?
- "Should" vs "must" vs "could" used inconsistently: what's required vs optional?

## Key Questions

- Which sentence would two engineers implement differently?
- What will cause a PR review debate because the spec doesn't say?
- If I highlighted every ambiguous word, how much of the spec is yellow?
- What question will someone ask 3 days into implementation that should be answered now?

## Finding Class Tagging (canonical)

This block is spliced into every reviewer / plan / check persona that emits findings into the v2 followups schema. Its job is to teach the persona how to populate the `class:` field on each finding, so the Judge step can route warn-vs-block correctly under the per-axis policy. The contents between the BEGIN/END sentinels are managed by the splice script in W3 — do not edit a spliced copy in place; edit this canonical file and re-run the splicer.

### The 7-class taxonomy

- `architectural` — structural reshape of the spec; new component; trust-boundary change. *Tiebreaker vs scope-cuts:* "structural reshape" goes to architectural; "remove an in-scope item" goes to scope-cuts. **Carve-outs (always architectural, even if it looks like documentation or contract):** data-loss, irreversible-migration, release-rollback-failure, supply-chain-risk.
- `security` — auth, authz, secret handling, prompt-injection, untrusted input. **Parity rule:** if you tag `class: security`, you MUST also emit `"sev:security"` in `tags[]`. The write-time enforcer repairs the gap one-way, but tagging at source preserves the audit signal.
- `contract` — API/CLI/schema pins, signature gaps. *Tiebreaker vs documentation:* if the fix is a code or schema change, it is contract; if the fix is prose-only, it is documentation.
- `documentation` — README, comments, plan/spec framing. The fix is prose-only; no code or schema moves.
- `tests` — missing test coverage. **Carve-out:** tests covering a *changed trust boundary*, *data migration*, *CLI/schema contract*, or a *previous regression* upgrade to `architectural` at the Judge step.
- `scope-cuts` — nice-to-haves; do-not-add suggestions; deferral candidates. **Carve-out:** if the cut would *destabilize delivery* (e.g., "this spec silently includes a second feature") it upgrades to `architectural`.
- `unclassified` — fail-closed fallback. Reviewers should NEVER emit this. The Judge coerces missing or invalid `class:` values into `unclassified` so they fall through to the most conservative bucket.

### Severity orthogonality

`class:` and `severity:` are orthogonal. They are not the same scale. A `class: security` finding can carry `severity: blocker` or `severity: major` or `severity: minor` depending on exploitability and blast radius. The class enum (`architectural` / `security` / `contract` / `documentation` / `tests` / `scope-cuts` / `unclassified`) is NOT a severity ranking — do not use it as one.

### Output format

Emit `class:` on every finding. Shape matches the v2 `findings.schema.json`:

```yaml
- persona: <your-persona-name>
  finding_id: <inferred or generated>
  severity: blocker | major | minor | nit
  class: architectural | security | contract | documentation | tests | scope-cuts
  # class_inferred: false   # default; do NOT set — Judge sets this on coercion
  # source_finding_ids: [<self>]   # default; Judge sets this after dedup
  tags: ["sev:security"]   # ONLY when class is security
  title: "...80 chars max..."
  body: "..."
  suggested_fix: "..."
```

### When unsure (decision tree)

When two classes look plausible, pick the higher one in this precedence:

`architectural > security > contract > tests > documentation > scope-cuts`

Higher class blocks more aggressively under the per-axis policy, so over-classifying is the safer error. Under-classifying lets a real defect slip through as a warn. If the finding feels load-bearing for delivery, lean architectural. If it touches auth, secrets, or untrusted input at all, lean security and add the `sev:security` tag.

### Worked examples

- "Plan does not document the new `--dry-run` flag in README" → `class: documentation`, `severity: minor`. Prose-only fix. Not a contract change because the flag itself is defined elsewhere; only its prose framing is missing.
- "Plan adds `--dry-run` flag but omits it from `argparse` and the CLI help table" → `class: contract`, `severity: major`. The fix is a code/schema change (argparse signature) and downstream callers will pin to it.
- "Plan migrates `followups.jsonl` to a new schema with no rollback path" → `class: architectural`, `severity: blocker`. Irreversible-migration carve-out fires even if it would otherwise look like a contract change.
- "Plan accepts a user-supplied branch name and interpolates it into a shell command" → `class: security`, `severity: blocker`, `tags: ["sev:security"]`. Untrusted input crosses a trust boundary into a privileged context.
- "Plan does not add a regression test for the previously-fixed PIPESTATUS bug" → `class: architectural` (tests carve-out: previous regression), `severity: major`. Tag stays `tests` only when there is no carve-out trigger.
- "Plan includes a stretch goal to also rebrand the dashboard" → `class: scope-cuts`, `severity: minor`. Suggest deferring; does not destabilize delivery of the core feature.

## Output Structure

### Critical Gaps
(Things that MUST be answered before implementation can start)

### Important Considerations
(Things that should be addressed but aren't blockers)

### Observations
(Non-blocking notes, suggestions, things to watch)

### Verdict
PASS / PASS WITH NOTES / FAIL — one sentence rationale
