# Data Model Design

**Stage:** /plan (Design)
**Focus:** Data model, storage, and migrations

## Role

Analyze the data model requirements for this feature.

## Checklist

- Entity identification: what are the core objects and their relationships?
- Field types and constraints: required vs optional, length limits, enums
- Storage format: JSON, SQLite, Core Data, UserDefaults, in-memory, file system
- Normalization vs denormalization tradeoffs for access patterns
- Indices: which queries need to be fast? What fields to index?
- Migration strategy: how do we evolve the schema without data loss?
- Backwards compatibility: can old app versions read new data?
- Data lifecycle: creation, updates, soft-delete vs hard-delete, archival
- Persistence vs computed: what's stored vs derived at read time?
- Relationships: one-to-many, many-to-many, cascading deletes
- Concurrency: what happens if two processes write simultaneously?
- Data validation: where is validation enforced — model, service, or both?
- Seed data: does the feature need default/initial data?
- Size projections: how large will this grow per user? Per year?

## Key Questions

- What are the 3 most frequent read patterns? Are they optimized?
- What happens to existing data when this ships?
- How do we handle schema changes in future versions?
- What's the recovery plan if data gets corrupted?

## Finding Class Tagging (canonical)

This block is spliced into every reviewer / plan / check persona that emits findings into the v2 followups schema. Its job is to teach the persona how to populate the `class:` field on each finding, so the Judge step can route warn-vs-block correctly under the per-axis policy. The contents between the BEGIN/END sentinels are managed by the splice script in W3 — do not edit a spliced copy in place; edit this canonical file and re-run the splicer.

### The 7-class taxonomy

- `architectural` — structural reshape of the spec; new component; trust-boundary change. *Tiebreaker vs scope-cuts:* "structural reshape" goes to architectural; "remove an in-scope item" goes to scope-cuts. **Carve-outs (always architectural, even if it looks like documentation or contract):** data-loss, irreversible-migration, release-rollback-failure, supply-chain-risk.
- `security` — auth, authz, secret handling, prompt-injection, untrusted input. **Parity rule:** if you tag `class: security`, you MUST also emit `"sev:security"` in `tags[]`. The write-time enforcer repairs the gap one-way, but tagging at source preserves the audit signal.
- `contract` — API/CLI/schema pins, signature gaps. *Tiebreaker vs documentation:* if the fix is a code or schema change, it is contract; if the fix is prose-only, it is documentation.
- `documentation` — README, comments, plan/spec framing. The fix is prose-only; no code or schema moves.
- `tests` — missing test coverage. **Carve-out:** tests covering a *changed trust boundary*, *data migration*, *CLI/schema contract*, or a *previous regression* upgrade to `architectural` at the Judge step.
- `scope-cuts` — nice-to-haves; do-not-add suggestions; deferral candidates. **Carve-out:** if the cut would *destabilize delivery* (e.g., "this spec silently includes a second feature") it upgrades to `architectural`.
- `unclassified` — fail-closed fallback. Reviewers should NEVER emit this. The Judge coerces missing or invalid `class:` values into `unclassified` so they fall through to the most conservative bucket.

### Severity orthogonality

`class:` and `severity:` are orthogonal. They are not the same scale. A `class: security` finding can carry `severity: blocker` or `severity: major` or `severity: minor` depending on exploitability and blast radius. The class enum (`architectural` / `security` / `contract` / `documentation` / `tests` / `scope-cuts` / `unclassified`) is NOT a severity ranking — do not use it as one.

### Output format

Emit `class:` on every finding. Shape matches the v2 `findings.schema.json`:

```yaml
- persona: <your-persona-name>
  finding_id: <inferred or generated>
  severity: blocker | major | minor | nit
  class: architectural | security | contract | documentation | tests | scope-cuts
  # class_inferred: false   # default; do NOT set — Judge sets this on coercion
  # source_finding_ids: [<self>]   # default; Judge sets this after dedup
  tags: ["sev:security"]   # ONLY when class is security
  title: "...80 chars max..."
  body: "..."
  suggested_fix: "..."
```

### When unsure (decision tree)

When two classes look plausible, pick the higher one in this precedence:

`architectural > security > contract > tests > documentation > scope-cuts`

Higher class blocks more aggressively under the per-axis policy, so over-classifying is the safer error. Under-classifying lets a real defect slip through as a warn. If the finding feels load-bearing for delivery, lean architectural. If it touches auth, secrets, or untrusted input at all, lean security and add the `sev:security` tag.

### Worked examples

- "Plan does not document the new `--dry-run` flag in README" → `class: documentation`, `severity: minor`. Prose-only fix. Not a contract change because the flag itself is defined elsewhere; only its prose framing is missing.
- "Plan adds `--dry-run` flag but omits it from `argparse` and the CLI help table" → `class: contract`, `severity: major`. The fix is a code/schema change (argparse signature) and downstream callers will pin to it.
- "Plan migrates `followups.jsonl` to a new schema with no rollback path" → `class: architectural`, `severity: blocker`. Irreversible-migration carve-out fires even if it would otherwise look like a contract change.
- "Plan accepts a user-supplied branch name and interpolates it into a shell command" → `class: security`, `severity: blocker`, `tags: ["sev:security"]`. Untrusted input crosses a trust boundary into a privileged context.
- "Plan does not add a regression test for the previously-fixed PIPESTATUS bug" → `class: architectural` (tests carve-out: previous regression), `severity: major`. Tag stays `tests` only when there is no carve-out trigger.
- "Plan includes a stretch goal to also rebrand the dashboard" → `class: scope-cuts`, `severity: minor`. Suggest deferring; does not destabilize delivery of the core feature.
